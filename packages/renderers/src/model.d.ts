/**
 * The report document — the single structure every renderer consumes.
 *
 * There are three output formats (PDF for the record copy, DOCX for the AD/DD review cycle,
 * JSON for machines) and they must never disagree about content. So the engine's results are
 * assembled into this shape once, and each renderer is a pure projection of it. A renderer
 * never computes a verdict, never resolves an mpe, and never decides applicability — if a
 * renderer needs a number that is not in this document, the fix belongs upstream.
 *
 * The layout of each form comes from `packages/rulepacks/forms/R76-2_2007_forms.json`, which
 * was transcribed from R 76-2:2007 itself. That separation is the same rule as everywhere
 * else in TulaSetu: the standard is data. Switching to the draft 5-part edition means loading
 * a different forms file, not editing a renderer.
